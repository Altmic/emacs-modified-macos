Emacs Modified for macOS is a distribution of GNU Emacs bundled with a
few select packages for LaTeX users and R developers, most notably
[AUCTeX](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/) and
[ESS](https://ess.r-project.org). The distribution is based on the
latest stable release of GNU Emacs
[compiled by David Caldwell](https://emacsformacosx.com).

Other than the additions mentioned above and some minor configuration,
this is a stock distribution of Emacs. Users of Emacs on other
platforms will appreciate the similar look and feel of the
application.
